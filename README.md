Every business cares about their customers. They want to have more of them. They want customers to spend more of their time and money with them, to build good relationship with their customers.

However, the resources are limited.

It takes effort and money for businesses to run ad-campaigns, to sustain an effective marketing team so as to resolve problems when potential and existing customers reach out to them.

So, businesses want to know more who is a more valuable customer.

Who is more valuable?: 

(i) a customer who made a `$1000` purchase 6 months back?  
(ii) a customer who made 10 small purchases last month?


It turns out customers who make small yet repeated purchases can be more valuable in the long run. So, it's a good idea for your marketing teams to focus on high value customers. 

But how to you quantify which customers are more valuable?

It is one of the most important metrics to measure at any growing company. Businesses use customer lifetime value to identify customer segments that are most valuable to the company. The longer a customer continues to purchase from a company, the greater their lifetime value becomes.

</div>

The amount the business spends to acquire every customer is the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC). It can be the expense incurred to both acquire them and to maintain them, calculated for predetermined durations (say a year).

Calculating CAC is calculated by _dividing your overall marketing expenses by the number of net new customers acquired in a given period of time_. 

CAC refers to both the resources and costs incurred to acquire an additional customer. Customer acquisition cost is a key business metric that is commonly used alongside the customer lifetime value (LTV) metric to measure value generated by a new customer.

Typically, the CAC for a given period is the total of all promotional costs divided by the number of new customers acquired. 

The actual acquisition cost can vary with the nature of business, some of the common components of acquisition cost are:
 - Paid per click advertising cost
 - TV Ads
 - Posters, Banner Ads
 - Paid sales and marketing staff
 - Social media campaigns (collecting emails, phone numbers etc)
 - Magazine, Journal and Newspaper ads
 - Mailers
 
The key is to include everything needed, including digital and non-digital medium, to acquire a new customer.

It's quite easy to compute an aggregate value.

Let's say your company spends `$`100k on sales and `$`70k on marketing. Through this the company acquired 400 new customers for the financial year. Then, the CAC would be: (100k+70k)/400 = `$`425 per customer.


__Why calculating the acquisition cost matters?__

Because you don't want to spend more than what you can possibly hope to earn from your customers over lifetime.
